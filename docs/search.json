This field focuses on the statistical analysis of training data.\nGenerally speaking, machine learning algorithms are divided into several phases:\n\nTraining phase (or learning phase):\n\nThe chosen model is subjected to a large number of significant examples\nThe system then seeks to learn implicit rules based on this data (called training data)\n\nInference phase:\n\nThe trained model can be used on new inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe training phase generally precedes the use of the model, although some systems continue to learn indefinitely if they have feedback on the results (this is called on-line learning).\nInputs provided during the inference phase can be processed even if they were not seen by the model during the learning phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nType of machine learning\n\nMachine learning uses different types of learning, with supervised learning and unsupervised learning playing a prominent role.\nDeep learning is a set of techniques that use neural networks to solve complex problems.\nReinforcement learning consists in learning by interacting with the agent’s environment."

The aim is to train the chosen model so that it can correctly predict the output for unlabeled inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervised learning is generally used for regression or classification:\n\nRegression is used when the output to be predicted can take continuous values\nClassification is the task of choosing a class (value) from all those possible.\n\nClassic supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, nearest neighbor algorithms, discriminant factor analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, random forests and vector support machines.\n\n\nUnsupervised learning\nWe therefore have input data for which we don’t know the associated output. The data set is therefore \\((x_{i})_{i=1,···,n}\\) and the aim of the system is to identify features common to the training data.\nUnsupervised learning is mainly composed of clustering algorithms. These algorithms seek to separate the input data into a given number of groups. Each element in the group must have characteristics close to those of elements in the same group, but relatively distant from those of other groups.\nThe most common unsupervised learning algorithms are the k-means algorithm, hierarchical ascending classification, principal component analysis, DBSCAN, singular value decomposition and some neural networks.\n\n\n\n\nSk, Singh. 2020. “The Hold-Up of the Century: Neural Networks Are Coming from Cognitive Science and Not Machine Learning.
