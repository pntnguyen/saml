# Classification

## Introduction to classification

The aim of classification is to group (partition, segment) $n$ observations into a number of homogeneous groups or classes. There are two main types of classification :

- [**Supervised classification**]{style="color:blue"}, often referred to simply as [classification]{style="color:blue"}

- [**Unsupervised classification**]{style="color:blue"}, sometimes called partitioning, segmentation, or [clustering]{style="color:blue"}.

## Supervised classification

In supervised classification,

- We already know how many groups exist in the population

- We know the group to which each observation in the population belongs

- We want to classify the observations in the right groups based on different variables

We can then use a classification rule to [predict]{style="color:blue"} the groups to which new observations belong.

Some examples of applications:

- Recognize hand written numbers

- Identify the type of cancer patients has

There are several families of **supervised classification methods**. The most common are [nearest neighbor method, discriminant factor analysis, classification trees, logistic regression, naive Bayesian, neural networks, support vector machines]{style="color:blue"}.

We have the data with n individuals described by their values of X and Y.

\begin{aligned}
X_n = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & \dots  & x_{1p} \\
    x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} & \dots  & x_{2p} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    x_{n1} & x_{n2} & x_{n3} & \dots  & x_{np}
\end{bmatrix}

Y_n = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    y_{1} \\
    y_{2} \\
    \vdots \\
    y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}

We want to predict the class $y_0$ of a new input $x_0 = (x_{01},x_{02},...,x_{0p})$


## Unsupervised classification

In unsupervised classification,

- In general, we don’t know how many groups exist in the population

- We don’t know the group to which each observation in the population belongs

- We want to classify observations into homogeneous groups based on different variables

Application examples:

- In psychology : the determination of personality types present in a group of individuals

- In text mining : partitioning e-mails or texts according to subject

There are several families of **unsupervised classification methods**. The most common are [hierarchical classification, k-means method, density-based classification, mixture of normal distributions]{style="color:blue"}.
